PLG_SEOFLI_XML_DESCRIPTION="<h2><strong>SEOFLI - SEO Friendly Links and Images</strong></h2><p>With this plugin title and alt attributes are set automatically. The attributes are important for search engine optimization, but unfortunately they are not respected very often. The plugin checks all links and images on these attributes. If they are not set, they are generated from the linked text or from the image name. Additionally there is the possibility to overwrite existing attributes with the automatically generated one.</p><p>The size of the images can be calculated and added to the img attributes. This option is important to avoid a jumping of the layout while loading the page and to increase the page load, because the browser does not have to calculate the size of the images.</p><p>I wish you success in optmizing your site! Please support my work and the free availability of the extension with the purchase of a donation code if it brings an added value to your site.</p><p>Project page: <a href="_QQ_"https://joomla-extensions.kubik-rubik.de/seofli-seo-friendly-links-and-images"_QQ_" target="_QQ_"_blank"_QQ_" title="_QQ_"SEOFLI - SEO Friendly Links and Images"_QQ_">SEOFLI - SEO Friendly Links and Images</a></p><p>Please write a review in the JED: <a href="_QQ_"http://extensions.joomla.org/extensions/extension/site-management/seo-a-metadata/seo-friendly-links-and-images"_QQ_" target="_QQ_"_blank"_QQ_" title="_QQ_"SEOFLI - SEO Friendly Links and Images in the Joomla!
