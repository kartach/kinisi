EO_ANONYMIZE_IP="Anonymize IP"
EO_ANONYMIZE_IP_DSC="When a customer of Google Analytics requests IP address anonymization, Google Analytics anonymizes the address as soon as technically feasible at the earliest possible stage of the collection network. The IP anonymization feature in Google Analytics sets the last octet of IPv4 visitor IP addresses and the last 80 bits of IPv6 addresses to zeros in memory shortly after being sent to the Google Analytics Collection Network. The full IP address is never written to disk in this case."

; Enhanced Link Attribution
EO_ENHANCED_LINK_ATTR="Enhanced Link Attribution"
EO_ENHANCED_LINK_ATTR_DSC="Enhanced Link Attribution improves the accuracy of your In-Page Analytics report by automatically differentiating between multiple links to the same URL on a single page by using link element IDs.<br><br><b>Notes:</b> This loads the js plugin and this call will block until the plugin is loaded. For the most accurate link attribution, each of the links on your page should have a unique element ID."
;
EO_ENHANCED_LINK_ATTR_COOKIE_NAME_DSC="Default: _gali<br>Example value entry: _ela<br><br>To use the default value, empty the field and save the plugin.<br>Only Alphabetic and Underscore characters allowed."
EO_DURATION="Duration"
EO_ENHANCED_LINK_ATTR_DURATION_DSC="Default: 30<br><br>The Cookie duration in seconds.<br>To use the default value, empty the field and save the plugin.<br>Only numbers are allowed."

EO_ENHANCED_LINK_ATTR_LEVELS_DSC="Default: 3<br><br>The Max DOM levels from link to look for element ID.<br>To use the default value, empty the field and save the plugin.<br>Only numbers are allowed."
EO_ENHANCED_LINK_ATTR_HELP="You can tag your pages to implement an enhanced link-tracking functionality that lets you:<br><br>- See separate information for multiple links on a page that all have the same destination. For example, if there are two links on the same page that both lead to the Contact Us page, then you see separate click information for each link.<br>- See when one page element has multiple destinations. For example, a Search button on your page is likely to lead to multiple destinations.<br>- Track buttons, menus, and actions driven by javascript.<br><br><b>Enable enhanced link attribution in the reports</b><br>After you update your tracking code, you then need to enable enhanced link attribution in your property settings:<br><br>1. Click Admin at the top of any Analytics page.<br>2. Navigate to the property for which you want to use enhanced link attribution, and click the Property Settings tab.<br>3. In the In-Page Analytics section, select the Use enhanced link attribution option.<br>4. Click Apply.<br><br>Enhanced link attribution offers more-detailed reports, and disambiguates clicks to the same destination page that come from more than one element on the page. However, the additional detail comes at the cost of some speed in generating the report, so only turn it on if you need it. You can always turn it off again if you no longer need it."

; Domains & Cookies
EO_FQDN_DESC="This is the Absolute Domain of your Joomla site.<br><br>A fully qualified domain name (FQDN), sometimes also referred as an absolute domain name, is a domain name that specifies its exact location in the tree hierarchy of the Domain Name System (DNS). It specifies all domain levels, including the top-level domain and the root zone.<br><br><b>Examples:</b><br>example.com<br>www.example.com<br>blog.example.com<br>other.subdomain.example.com<br><br>When set to Auto, the current one will be used. This means that in the case you are able to access i.e., example.com from www.example.com (or any other subdomain), then the current Absolute Domain (FQDN) will be the one you access it from. For users that prefer Scheme Relative or Absolute Local URLs and need to force the plugin to use a specific Absolute Domain (FQDN) that will not change, then the 'Custom' option should be used.<br><br>If you have set the $live_site variable in your configuration.php file, then you should not worry and choose Auto here, although on websites that use both http and https on different pages the $live_site causes trouble and is not recommended."
EO_AUTO="Auto"
EO_FQDN_CUSTOM_DSC="Accepted format should be without scheme (http or https), without :// and without the relative path.<br><br><b>Correct Entry Examples:</b><br>example.com<br>www.example.com<br>other.subdomain.example.com<br><br><b>Wrong Entry Examples:</b><br>http://example.com<br>http://www.example.com/joomla/<br>http://example.com/index.php<br>www.example.com/joomla"
;
EO_DOMAIN_MAIN="Domain (Main)"
EO_DOMAIN_DSC="An example of what you main domain is, is if you use www.example.com as your Absolute Domain (FQDN) for your website, then your main domain is example.com once www is a subdomain of example.com which uses com as the TLD (Top Level Domain).<br><br>In a similar way, if you use www.example.co.uk as your Absolute Domain (FQDN), your main domain is example.co.uk which uses co.uk as the TLD.<br><br>If your Absolute Domain (FQDN) setting uses your main domain example.com, here you can choose the option 'Absolute Domain (FQDN)'."
EO_DOMAIN_CUSTOM_DSC="Accepted format should be without scheme (http or https), without :// without www and without the relative path.<br><br><b>Correct entry examples:</b><br>example.com<br>example.co.uk<br><br><b>Wrong entry examples:</b><br>www.example.com<br>http://example.com<br>http://www.example.com/joomla/<br>http://example.com/index.php<br>example.com/joomla"
;
EO_COOKIE_DOMAIN="Cookie Domain"
EO_COOKIE_DOMAIN_DSC="By default, the analytics.js library uses a single cookie named _ga to store a unique client identifier (Client ID), which is a randomly generated number. Once the ID is generated it's stored in the cookie and is included with each hit / request sent to Google Analytics. This ID is later used by Google Analytics servers to calculate visitor, session, and campaign data. The _ga cookie is a first-party cookie that can only be accessed by the domain on which the JavaScript is run. For certain implementations you might need to modify how Google Analytics sets its cookie."
;
EO_COOKIE_NAME_CUSTOM_DSC="Only Alphabetic and Underscore characters allowed."
EO_COOKIE_NAME_DSC="Universal Analytics uses a single first-party cookie containing an anonymous identifier used to distinguish users.<br><br><b>Note:</b> It is not required setting cookies to transmit data to Google Analytics."
;
EO_COOKIE_EXPIRES="Cookie Expires"
EO_COOKIE_EXPIRES_DSC="Default: 31536000<br><br>The cookie is set to expire in 2 years and the expiration is refreshed every time a hit is sent.<br><br><b>Modifying Cookie Expiration</b><br>Every time a hit / request is sent to Google Analytics servers, the cookie expiration time is updated to be the current time plus the value in the Cookie Expires time (in seconds) into the future. For example setting it to 60, would set the cookie expiration time to 60 seconds (1 minute) into the future. If you set the Cookie Expires time to 0 (zero) seconds, the cookie turns into a session based cookie and expires once the current browser session ends.<br><br>Only numbers are allowed."
;
EO_COOKIE_PATH="Cookie Path"
EO_COOKIE_PATH_DSC="Default: /<br><br>While this setting can be modified, it is highly discouraged. Ideally there should only be a single cookie set for a given domain."
EO_COOKIE_PATH_CUSTOM_DSC="Only Alphanumeric, Underscore and Forward Slash characters allowed."
;
EO_TRACK_MULTIPLE_DOMAINS="Track Multiple Domains"
EO_TRACK_MULTIPLE_DOMAINS_DSC="Example: www.example.uk -and- www.example.cn -and- www.example.fr<br><br><b>Note:</b> When Track Multiple Domains is used and the Secondary Domains field has at least one domain listed, then the Cookie Domain setting is ignored and set to <b>auto</b>."
;
EO_DOMAIN_TYPE="Domain Type"
EO_DOMAIN_TYPE_DSC="When Track Multiple Domains is used, here you can set the Domain Type."
EO_PRIMARY="Primary"
EO_SECONDARY="Secondary"
;
EO_SECONDARY_DOMAINS="Secondary Domains"
EO_SECONDARY_DOMAINS_DSC="When Track Multiple Domains is used and the Domain Type is set to Primary, you can set a list of Secondary Domains (one by line) for Cross Domain Tracking. The plugin must be installed on all those domains listed here. On those domains the Domain Type should be set to Secondary. When the Domain Type is set to Secondary then this field will not be used."

; Exclude Traffic
EO_DNT="Respect DNT"
EO_DNT_DSC="Do Not Track (DNT) is an HTTP header sent by the client software to prevent tracking by web services. It requests the web application to disable tracking. When enabled and a visitor sends the DNT header, the plugin will not execute for that particular visitor, which means that no connection to the Google Analytics service will occur. Thus, the visitor will not be tracked.<br><br><b>Note:</b> It is disabled by default, but should be enabled on production environments."
EO_OPTOUT="Opt-Out"
EO_OPTOUT_DSC="In some cases, it may be necessary to disable the Google Analytics tracking code on a page without having to remove the code snippet. For example, you might do this if your site's privacy policy includes the ability for a visitor to opt-out of Google Analytics tracking, or if you as the owner or webmaster of the site have no other way to exclude yourself from the statistics.<br><br>The tracking snippet now includes a window property that, when set to true, disables the tracking snippet from sending data to Google Analytics. When Google Analytics attempts to set a cookie or send data back to the Google Analytics servers, it will check for whether this property is set to true. If it is, it will have the same effect as if the visitor had the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Plugin installed.<br><br>To use this functionality you will need to create an HTML link to your site to execute the opt-out logic. Go to the area (or article) of your site that you want your Opt-Out link for the visitor to exist and make sure it has <b>javascript:gaOptout()</b> as its hypertext reference (href). If it is an article, make sure you have configured your editor properly in order to allow such input. If your server is running ModSecurity it may also be necessary to whilelist one or more rules.<br><br>When a user clicks the opt-out HTML link, the gaOptout function will execute. It will set a cookie for a long time in the future and disable data collection. When a user returns to this site, the script will check to see if the opt-out cookie has been set. If it has, then the data collection will also be disabled.<br><br><b>Note:</b> When enabled, the opt-out part of code will always be there regardless of the DNT configuration on both the visitor's browser or your site, so that the visitor can have full control of the situation. This means that in the case that your DNT setting is respecting the visitor's DNT setting and not tracking him/her, the visitor can still set the opt-out cookie to their browser.<br><br>For more information please visit: <a href=\"https://eorisis.com/google-analytics/doc\">https://eorisis.com/google-analytics/doc</a>"
EO_OPTOUT_COOKIE_EXPIRES_DSC="Default: 80<br><br>Opt-Out Cookie expiration period in years. It is recommended to be a long time in the future."
EO_FUNC_NAME="Function Name"
EO_OPTOUT_FUNC_NAME_DSC="Default: gaOptout<br><br>Only Alphabetic and Underscore characters allowed."

For example if you enter the keyword amazonaws.com in the Hostname List, then any visit from that host will not be tracked.<br><br>For information on how to exclude your own traffic using a custom User-Agent please visit eorisis.com/google-analytics<br><br><b>Notes:</b> This functionality is dynamic and cannot work if you cache the HTML of your pages. Make sure you have the 'System - Cache' plugin disabled. Remember that anything excluded here will not even be sent to Google Analytics. Regex, Wildcards, CIDR or IP Ranges are not yet supported. All strings are case-insensitive."
